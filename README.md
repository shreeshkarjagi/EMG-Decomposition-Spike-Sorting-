# EMG-Decomposition-Spike-Sorting-

The purpose of this project is to achieve an EMG decomposition/Spike Sorting of given input signals. We wish to know how many neurons are responsible for the EMG signal.
This presentation includes the data and figures from the decomposition's eight building steps, which include: Inputting the file -> Filtering the signal -> Detecting spikes -> Aligning spikes -> Extracting features -> Clustering spikes -> Classifying spikes ->Analysis. 
It concludes with a discussion of the results for each step and suggestions for further development that could potentially improve the decomposition.
